# (ArcGIS.js <= 100)
### Welcome to the 100 Lines or Less ArcGIS JavaScript Code Challenge!

Everybody loves a cool mapping app.  Here's your chance to write the coolest application in 100 lines or less with the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/index.html) and win a one-year subscription to [ArcGIS Online](http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/arcgisonline) and a free 2014 Esri Dev Summit pass - a $3,500 value, a free pass to the 2014 Esri Dev Summit - a $1000 value or a $100 Esri Press gift certificate.  Anyone can enter, but just to make things a little more exciting, we'll be announcing the winners at the [2014 Esri International Developer Summit](http://www.esri.com/events/devsummit/index.html).  You don't need to attend the DevSummit to win or claim your prize however.

To enter all you need to do is make a pull request to submit your code (see How to Enter below).    

Best of luck!

## Rules

1. Max 100 (sloc) lines of client-side JavaScript code. Max 80 chars per line. Not compressed.
2. Must use the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/index.html).
3. All JavaScript code must be in a single .js file (see Example below).
4. All project code must reside in a single folder (HTML, css, js).
5. Application must be fully functional, portable, deployable and accessable from any public web-enabled directory.  
6. Applications must be freely distributable via Apache 2.0 license.
7. IMPORTANT: Libraries other than the ArcGIS API for JavaScript can be used and do not count toward the 100 line limit. Libraries referenced must be published and publicly available prior to March 1, 2013.  So that means you can't write libraries to hide your ArcGIS code!  You can use previously published ArcGIS libraries however.

See all rules, terms and conditions [here](http://edn1.esri.com/terms%20and%20conditions%20agreement.pdf).
