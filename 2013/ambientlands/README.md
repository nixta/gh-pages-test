### Discover a world of music on a map

This app uses both the [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/index.html) and the [Souncloud API](http://developers.soundcloud.com/), to discover the music from the world while browsing a map.

### 3 Modes of discovering are implemented
- Travel&Discover: Navigate freely on the map. The local music of the area will automatically plays
- Play On Click: Disable navigation and force the app to play only the music you have chosen when you select it from an icon's popup
- Registered Travel: Display the menu to let you choose between the available travels. Just see and listen!


### Notes
- All songs are moderns (re)interpretations of traditionals songs or musics genres ranged from 4000 B.C to 1950 A.D.
- Despite the developer's awareness, the compliance of the song with the country can not be fully guaranteed
- wrapAround180 is set to false, preventing the user to go around the world, because of a bug with graphics in the API. See here: http://forums.arcgis.com/threads/26180-wraparound180-causes-screen-coords-to-get-out-of-sync-breaking-geometry-capabilities
