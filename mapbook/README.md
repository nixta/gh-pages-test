# HTML5 Bookmarks
### Knockout.js and html5 bookmark tool

Live demo [here] (http://esri.github.com/100-lines-or-less-js/mapbook/index.html)

This app uses the [knockout.js] (http://knockoutjs.com/) framework along with the compact version of ESRI's [ArcGIS API for JavaScript](http://help.arcgis.com/en/webapi/javascript/arcgis/index.html) to create a modern bookmarking tool. Bookmarks are stored using [HTML5 Web Storage] (http://www.html5rocks.com/en/features/storage) to maintain them across sessions. 

The app implements the [History API] (http://slides.html5rocks.com/#history-api) to allow users to move through bookmarks using the forward and back buttons. The url's are set up to allow the user to link to bookmarks so they can save their session state. 

The site has been designed to work responsively, tested on desktop and iPhone 5.
